 <p>
  Good evening, I'd like to provide the American people with an update on our efforts to protect the integrity of very important 2020 election.
 </p>
 <p>
  晚上好，我在这里给美国人民报告一下我们在保护非常重要的2020大选之公正性方面的努力进展。
 </p>
 <p>
  If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us, if you count the votes that came in late. We'll look into them very strongly, but a lot of votes came in late.
 </p>
 <p>
  如果计算合法票数，我轻松获胜。 如果算上非法选票，如果算上晚到的票，他们可以试图从我们这里窃取大选。我们会非常强力地介入弄清此事，但是很多票是晚到的。
 </p>
 <p>
  I've already decisively won many critical states, including massive victories in Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, to name just a few. We won these and many other victories, despite historic election interference from big media, big money and big tech, as everybody, saw, we won by historic numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  我已经很确定的赢得了许多关键州的胜利，包括在佛罗里达州、爱荷华州、印第安纳州、俄亥俄州的大胜，这里仅举几例。 我们赢了这些州，以及其它许多州，尽管受到了大媒体、大金主和科技巨头的历史性的大选干扰，正如大家都看到的，我们以历史性的票数胜出。
 </p>
 <div class="AD_Embed__Wrap-sc-1xslmin-0 igMuqX module desktop">

 </div>
 <p>
  And the pollsters got it knowingly wrong, they got it knowingly wrong. We had polls -  it was so ridiculous, and everybody knew that at the time there was no blue wave that they predicted. They thought there was going to be a big blue wave. That was false. It was done for suppression reasons.
 </p>
 <p>
  那些民调机构们是明知故错，他们明知故错。 我们有些民调，简直太荒谬了。每个人当时都知道，没有他们预测的蓝色浪潮。他们认为将会有个巨大的蓝色浪潮。那是虚假的，他们那样做，是出于压制别人投票的原因。
 </p>
 <p>
  But instead there was a big red wave. And it's been properly acknowledged actually by the media. They were I think very impressed. But that was after the fact. That doesn't do us any good.
 </p>
 <p>
  但反而是出现了巨大的红色浪潮。事实上，媒体也适当的承认了这一点。我认为他们也对此印象深刻。但那不过是事后诸葛。那对我们一点好处都没有。
 </p>
 <p>
  We kept the senate, despite having twice as many seats to defend as Democrats, and in a really much more competitive states. We've did a fantastic job with the Senate. I think we're very proud of what's happened there. We have many more seats to defend.
 </p>
 <p>
  我们保住了在参议院的席位，尽管我们比民主党有多两倍的席位要保持，而且是在竞争激烈的多的各州。我们在参议员选举方面做得非常出色。 我觉得我们为在那里达成的结果而感到自豪。 我们有更多席位需要捍卫。
 </p>
 <div class="AD_Embed__Wrap-sc-1xslmin-0 igMuqX module desktop">

  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  They spent almost $200 million on Senate races in South Carolina and Kentucky alone to races and hundreds of millions of dollars overall against us at the national level. Our opponents major donors were Wall Street bankers and special interests. Our major donors were police officers, farmers everyday citizens.
 </p>
 <p>
  民主党仅在南卡罗来纳州和肯塔基州的参议院竞选中就花费了近2亿美元，在联邦一级，总共有数亿美元之多的金钱投入来反对我们。 我们的对手主要捐助者是华尔街银行家和特殊利益集团。我们的主要捐助者是警察、农民和普通公民。
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet for the first time ever, we lost zero races in the house. I was talking to Kevin McCarthy today. He said he couldn't believe it. Zero. This is very unusual thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  然而这是有史以来，我们第一次在众议院选举中一席未失。 我今天在和（少数党领袖）凯文·麦卡锡（Kevin McCarthy）交谈时说，他说他简直不敢相信。一席未失。非常不寻常的事情。
 </p>
 <p>
  Zero, and actually won many new seats, with I think many more on the way. This was also the year of the republican woman. More republican women were elected to Congress than ever before. That's a great achievement.
 </p>
 <p>
  一席未失，实际上我们赢得了许多新席位，而我认为还有更多席位在路上。 这也是共和党女性的一年，当选国会议员的共和党女性比以往任何时候都多。 那是一个伟大的成就。
 </p>
 <p>
  I won the largest share of non white voters of any Republican in 60 years, including historic numbers of Latino, African American, Asian American and Native American voters. The largest ever in our history. We grew our party by 4 million voters, the greatest turnout in Republican Party history.
 </p>
 <div class="AD_Embed__Wrap-sc-1xslmin-0 igMuqX module desktop">
  <div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  我赢得了六十年来比任何共和党总统参选人都多的非白人选民的选票，包括历史性的来自拉丁美洲裔，非洲裔，亚裔美国人和美国原住民的选票。有史以来最多的一次。投票给共和党的增加了400万选民，这是共和党在历史上得到投票人数最多的一次。
 </p>
 <p>
  Democrats are the party of the big donors, the big media, the big tech, it seems and Republicans have become the party of the American worker. And that's what's happened. And we're also I believe the party of inclusion.
 </p>
 <p>
  民主党是大金主，大媒体，大科技公司的党派，看起来，共和党人已经成为美国工薪民众的党派。所发生的就是这样。而且我认为我们也是包容性的党派。
 </p>
 <p>
  As everyone now recognizes, media polling was election interference, in the true sense of that word, by powerful special interests. These are really phony polls, I have to call them phony polls, fake polls were designed to keep our voters at home, created the illusion of momentum for Mr. Biden, and diminish republicans ability to raise funds. They were what's called suppression polls. Everyone knows that now.
 </p>
 <p>
  现在大家都认识到，媒体发布的民调结果是干扰大选，真正意义上的大选干扰，来自强大的特殊利益集团们（的大选干扰）。 这些是真正的虚假民调，我不得不称虚假民调，设计出来的虚假民调，以让我们的投票者留在家里（不出来投票），这制造了拜登先生的虚幻势头，并削弱了共和党筹集资金的能力，这就是所称的压制性民调，现在大家都知道了。
 </p>
 <p>
  And it's never been used, to the extent that it's been used in this last election. To highlight just a few examples, the day before Election, Quinnipiac, which was wrong on every occasion that I know, had Joe Biden up by five points in Florida. And they were off by 8.4 points. And I won Florida easily, easily. So they had me losing Florida by a lot. And I ended up winning Florida by a lot. Other than that, they were very accurate.
 </p>
 <div class="AD_Embed__Wrap-sc-1xslmin-0 igMuqX module desktop">
  <div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  虚假民调从来没有被运用到像在刚过去的这场大选中的程度。这里我仅用几个例子来说明这一点，就在选前一天，据我所知此次搞错的昆尼皮亚克民调说，乔·拜登在佛罗里达赢5个百分点。结果他们有8.4个百分点的出入。我轻松赢得了佛罗里达州的胜利。 而他们的结果是我会在佛州大比分落败。结果是我在佛罗里达大比分胜出。除了结果不准确， 他们其它都非常准确。
 </p>
 <p>
  They had him up four points in Ohio, and they were up by 12.2 points. And we also won Ohio, great State of Ohio very easily. The Washington Post said Biden up 17 points in Wisconsin, and it was basically even they were up by about 17 points. And they knew that they're not stupid people, they knew that suppression.
 </p>
 <p>
  在俄亥俄州，昆尼皮亚克民调给拜登多4个百分点，多12.2个百分点。 而我们也很轻松地赢得了俄亥俄州。《华盛顿邮报》的民调说拜登在威斯康星州领先17个百分点，也就是说他们甚至超出17个百分点之多。 而那些做民调的明知自己不是愚蠢的人，他们知道那种压制。
 </p>
 <p>
  There are now only a few states yet to be decided in the presidential race. The voting apparatus of those states are run in all cases by Democrats. We were winning in all the key locations by a lot actually. And then our numbers started miraculously getting whittled away in secret.
 </p>
 <p>
  现在在总统大选的结果中，只有几个州尚需确定结果。这些州的投票机构在均由民主党人运作。 实际上，我们在所有关键地区都赢了很多票。紧接着，我们的票数开始奇蹟般地秘密地被消减了。
 </p>
 <p>
  And they wouldn't allow legally permissible observers. We went to court in a couple of instances and we were able to get the observers put in. And when the observers got there, they wanted them 60-70 feet away 80 feet 100 feet away or outside the building to observe people inside the building.
 </p>
 <div class="AD_Embed__Wrap-sc-1xslmin-0 igMuqX module desktop">
  <div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  And we won a case, a big case. And we have others happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  而且他们不允许法律上允许的观察员在旁。 我们就几个情形诉诸法庭，之后我们能够让观察员进场。而当观察员到现场后，他们被要求在60-70英尺外，80英尺100英尺外，或在计票场所的外面来观察在里面的人。我们赢了一个诉讼，很大的诉讼。我们还有其它提吿诉讼在进行中。
 </p>
 <p>
  There are a lot of lots of litigation. Even beyond our litigation is tremendous amount of litigation generally, because of how unfair this process was. And I predicted that. I've been talking about mail and voting for a long time.  It's really destroyed our system. It's a corrupt system.  And it makes people corrupt even if they aren't by nature, but they become corrupt, it's too easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  已有了很多的提吿诉讼。甚至在我们的诉讼之外，总体上来说还有大量的诉讼，因为这个过程是如此之不公。我就预料到会有这样的事情发生。我一直在谈邮寄选票和选举（舞弊），说了很长时间了。这真的是败坏了我们的选举体系。这使得人们即使本性不想腐败，也被卷入到腐败之中，他们变的腐败了，（腐败）太容易了。
 </p>
 <p>
  They want to find out how many votes they need and then they seem to be able to find them. They wait and wait and then they find them. And you see that on election night we were ahead in vote in North Carolina by a lot tremendous number of votes. And we're still ahead by a lot but not as many because they're finding ballots, all of a sudden oh we have some mailing ballots.
 </p>
 <div class="AD_Embed__Wrap-sc-1xslmin-0 igMuqX module desktop">
  <div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  他们想知道他们需要多少票，然后（需要多少）他们似乎就能够找到多少。 他们等啊等，然后就找到了他们（所需要的票）。 你们也看到了，在选举之夜，我们在北卡罗来纳州的票数领先非常多。 而且我们仍然领先很多，但已经没那么多了，因为他们正在找到选票，突然之间，他们说：「啊，我们又来了一些邮寄选票。」
 </p>
 <p>
  It's amazing how those mailing ballots so one sided. I know that it's supposed to be to the advantage of the democrats, but in all cases they are so one sided, we were up by nearly 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania, I won Pennsylvania by a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  令人讶异的是，这些邮寄选票是如此一边倒的倾向于民主党人。我就知道，它是会有利于民主党人，但在所有情况下，都是一边倒，我们在宾夕法尼亚州以将近70万张的票数领先，在宾夕法尼亚州，我们胜出了很多票。
 </p>
 <p>
  And that gets whittled down. I think they said now we're up by 90,000 votes and they'll keep coming and coming and coming, they find them all over. And they don't want us to have any observers, although we won a court case, the judge said you have to have observers.
 </p>
 <p>
  后来领先逐渐缩小。他们说现在我们领先90,000票，然后他们的选票会持续进来，进来，再进来，他们会在任何地方找到他们需要的选票。 尽管我们赢了一场提诉，法官说必须要有观察员，但他们不希望我们有任何观察员。
 </p>
 <p>
  Likewise, and they're appealing. Actually they're appealing. We won a case that we want people to watch and we want observers, and they're actually appealing which is sort of interesting, I wonder why that appeal that. (What we ) only want to do is have people watch as they do the vote tabulations.
 </p>
 <div class="AD_Embed__Wrap-sc-1xslmin-0 igMuqX module desktop">
  <div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  同样的，他们在申诉。 事实上，他们正在申诉。 我们赢了一个诉讼，想要观察员们到现场观察，我们希望有观察员，结果他们为此上诉，这有点意思。我不明白他们为著上诉是怎么回事。我们想要的只不过是在他们计票的时候，有人在旁边看着而已。
 </p>
 <p>
  Likewise, in Georgia we won by a lot, a lot, with a lead of over, getting close to 300,000 votes on election night in Georgia. And by the way, got whittled down. And now it's getting to be to a point where I'll go from winning by a lot to perhaps being even down a little bit. In Georgia a pipe burst in a faraway location totally unrelated to the location of what was happening and they stopped counting for four hours, and a lot of things happened. The election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats.
 </p>
 <p>
  同样，在选举之夜，我们在乔治亚州的获得很多票领先，获得接近300,000的票数。也顺便提一下，领先被消减了。 而现在到了这样的地步，我从赢很多到了甚至低了一点点。 在乔治亚州，在一个与计票点完全无关的遥远位置，一根管道破裂，他们就停止计票四个小时，结果很多事情就在期间发生了。乔治亚州的选举机构是由民主党人运作的。
 </p>
 <p>
  We also add margins of 300,000 in Michigan were way up in Michigan, we won the state. And in Wisconsin we did likewise fantastically well. And that got whittled down every in every case they got whittled down.
 </p>
 <p>
  在密歇根州，我们一度领先300,000票大幅领先，我们赢了密歇根州。 在威斯康星州，我们的表现也同样出色。结果，领先的票数也是一个个被消减掉了。
 </p>
 <div class="AD_Embed__Wrap-sc-1xslmin-0 igMuqX module desktop">
  <div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  Today we're on track to win Arizona, we only need to carry I guess 55% of the remaining vote. 55% margins and that's a margin that we've significantly exceeded so we'll see what happens with that, but we're on track to do okay in Arizona. Our goal is to defend the integrity of the election, will not allow the corruption to steal such an important election or any election for that matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  今天，在密歇根州亚利桑那州我们走在胜利的路上，我们只需要赢得未计选票的55％，即可胜出。55％，而这个比例在已计入票中我们是大大超出，所以，我们将看看会发生什么，但我们有望在亚利桑那做到这一点。 我们的目标是捍卫选举的公正性，不允许腐败分子窃取如此重要的选举，或如此窃取任何选举。
 </p>
 <p>
  And we can't allow silence, anybody to silence your voters and manufacture results. I've never had I've been doing a lot of public things for a long time, I've never had anything that's been as inspirational by people following, talking, sending things to us.  I've never seen such such love and such affection and such spirit, as I've seen for this. people know what's happening and they see what's happening and it's before their eyes. And there are many instances which will be reported very shortly. There's tremendous litigation going on.
 </p>
 <div class="AD_Embed__Wrap-sc-1xslmin-0 igMuqX module desktop">
  <div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  而且我们不能允许噤声，不允许任何人使选民无法发声，并制造结果。很长时间以来我一直参与很多公众事务，我从来没有见过这样出现一种如此令人鼓舞的现象：人们在就此事跟进，谈论，送知情之事给我们。我从未见过像在这件事中表现出来的如此的爱，如此的真挚情感和如此的精神。人们知道在发生著什么，他们也看到了在发生著什么，并且就在他们眼前发生著。 并且有许多实例，将很快被报导出来。 大量的诉讼正在进行着。
 </p>
 <p>
  And this is a case where they're trying to steal an election. They're trying to rig an election. And we can't let that happen. Detroit and Philadelphia known as two of the most corrupted political places anywhere in our country. Easily (they)  cannot be responsible for engineering the outcome of a presidential race, a very important presidential race.
 </p>
 <p>
  而这是一件他们正在试图窃取大选的事情。 他们正企图操控选举。 我们不能让这种情况发生。底特律和费城是美国知名的最政治腐败的两个地方。 自然地，他们不能成为总统大选结果的操控者，而且是这样一次非常重要的总统大选。
 </p>
 <p>
  Pennsylvania Democrats have gone to the state Supreme Court to try and ban our election observers, and very strongly Now we won the case, but they're, they're going forward, they don't want anybody in there, they don't want anybody watching them as they count the ballots.
 </p>
 <p>
  宾夕法尼亚州的民主党人已去州最高法院，企图禁止我们的选举观察员。我们现在已经强力赢得了这个诉讼。但他们仍然一意孤行，他们还是不想让任何人在场，他们不想让别人在他们计票的时候旁观。
 </p>
 <div class="AD_Embed__Wrap-sc-1xslmin-0 igMuqX module desktop">
  <div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  I can't imagine why, there's absolutely no legitimate reason why they would not want to have people watching this process. Because if it's straight they would be here should be proud of it. Instead they're trying, obviously to commit fraud. There's no question about that. In Philadelphia, observers have been kept far away, very far away, so far that people are using binoculars to try and see. There's been tremendous problems caused. They put paper on all of the windows, so you can't see in it. People that are banned are very unhappy and become somewhat violent.
 </p>
 <p>
  我无法想像为什么，没有任何合理的理由使得他们不想让人观察他们的计票过程。因为如果那是公正的，他们应该对引以为豪才是。相反地，他们显然就是在企图舞弊，这毫无疑问。在费城，观察员被挡在很远很远的地方，远到他们要想看得用望远镜才行。这造成了巨大的问题。他们用纸把所有的窗户都封起来，这样你就看不见里面在干什么。被禁止观察的人们非常不满，场面甚至变的有些暴力。
 </p>
 <p>
  The 11th Circuit ruled that in Georgia the votes have been in by election day that they should be in by Election Day, and they weren’t. Votes are coming in after election day. And they had a ruling already that you have to have the votes in by Election Day. To the best of my knowledge votes should be in by election day. And they didn't do that,
 </p>
 <div class="AD_Embed__Wrap-sc-1xslmin-0 igMuqX module desktop">
  <div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  第11选区法庭判决，在乔治亚州，投票一直是在截止到大选当天进行的，而且应该在选举日当天，而实际上不是。大选日过后，还有选票进来。 他们已经裁定：必须在选举日之前选票到位。据我所知，选票应截止到选举日。 他们并没有那样做。
 </p>
 <p>
  Democrat officials never believed they could win this election honestly, I really believe that that's why they did the mail-in ballots where there's tremendous corruption and fraud going on. That's why they mailed out tens of millions of unsolicited ballots without any verification measures whatsoever.
 </p>
 <p>
  民主党官员从未相信过自己能诚实地赢得大选。我真的相信，这就是为什么他们大量邮寄投票的原因，其中有大量腐败和舞弊行为在发生著。 这就是为什么他们邮寄了数千万未经索要（不请自来）而发出的选票，没有经过任何验证等手续。
 </p>
 <p>
  And I've told everybody that these things would happen, because I've seen it happen, because I watched a lot of different elections, before they decided to go with this big massive election with tens of millions of ballots going out to everybody, in many cases totally unsolicited.
 </p>
 <p>
  我已经告诉所有人，这些事情将会发生，因为我已经看到了有这样的情形发生，是因为在他们决定进行这次大规模的、将数千万张选票寄送给大众（而很多时候都是未经索要便寄出）的行动之前，我观察过了许多不同的选举。
 </p>
 <p>
  This was unprecedented in American history. This was by design. Despite years of claiming to care about the election security, they refuse to include any requirement to verify signatures, identities, or even determine whether they're eligible or ineligible to vote, people are walking in there. they have no idea, they just take in numbers, they're writing down things. The workers and doing a lot of bad things. We have a lot of information coming. and the litigation that you'll see, that will shake even you people off and you've seen it all the officials overseeing the counting in Pennsylvania and other key states are all part of a corrupt democrat machine that you've written about. And for a long time you've been writing about the corrupt democrat machine.
 </p>
 <div class="AD_Embed__Wrap-sc-1xslmin-0 igMuqX module desktop">
  <div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  这在美国历史上是前所未有的。 这是设计出来的。尽管多年来声称要关心选举安全，他们却拒绝确认任何包括任何验证签名、身份、甚至拒绝确认他们是否有资格投票，人们走进那里，他们也不知道来者是谁， 他们只是计入票数，写下结果，选务人员做了很多坏事。我们收到了很多信息，还有诉讼，你会发现，这甚至会让你们都震撼，你们已经看到了，所有监督宾夕法尼亚州及其他关键州的计票的官员，都是你们所报导的腐败的民主党机器的一部分。很长时间以来，你们一直在报导关于这个腐败的民主党机器。
 </p>
 <p>
  I went to school there and I know a lot about. it hasn't changed a long time ago and hasn't changed. it has gotten worse. In Pennsylvania, partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the state to be received three days after the election. And we think much more than that. And they're counting those without even postmarks or any identification whatsoever. So you don't have postmarks. You don't have identification.
 </p>
 <p>
  我曾在（宾州）那边上学，我对他们那个机器很了解。很久以前，它就没有改变，也从来没有改变过， 它变得更糟了。 在宾夕法尼亚州，民主党人允许在大选日后三天，还可以接受选票。 而且，我们认为还远不止于此。 他们还正在计入那些没有邮戳或任何标识的邮寄选票。 没有邮戳，没有身份证明。
 </p>
 <p>
  There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the nation, our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place and I wouldn't say has the best reputation for election integrity. All workers in Michigan were duplicating ballots. But when our observers attempted to challenge the activity, those co-workers jumped in front of the volunteers to block their view so that they couldn't see what they were doing.

  全国各地都有许多令人不安的异常行为，我们的竞选团队被拒绝观察底特律的任何计票活动。 底特律是另一个在我看来选举没有选举诚信好名声的地方。密西根州的所有选务人员都在复制选票。 但是，当我们的观察员试图质疑他们的行为时，他们的那些同事就跳到志愿者面前，阻挡他们的视线，以至于志愿者们看不到那些选务人员在做什么。

  And it became a little bit dangerous. One major hub for counting ballots in Detroit covered up the windows again with large pieces of cardboard. And so they wanted to protect and block the counting area they didn't want anybody seeing the counting even though these were observers, who were legal observers who was supposed to be there
 </p>
 <p>
  而且这变得有点危险。 在底特律一个主要的机票中心也是用大块硬纸板挡住了窗户。 他们希望以此来保护和封锁计票处。他们也不希望任何人看到计票活动，即便他们是观察员，他们是本来就该在那里的合法观察员。
 </p>
 <p>
  In Detroit, there were hours of unexplained delay in delivering many of the votes for counting. The final batch did not arrive until four in the morning. And even though the polls closed at eight o'clock so they brought it in, and the batches came in and nobody knew where they came from.
 </p>
 <p>
  在底特律，在许多运送被计数的选票中，有数小时的无法解释的延误。 最后一批直到凌晨四点才送达。 即使投票处在八点钟关闭，他们还是被送了进来，一批批的进来，没人知道他们来自哪里。
 </p>
 <p>
  We've also been denied access to observe and critical places in Georgia, and multiple swing states counting was halted for hours and hours on election night with results withheld from major democrat run locations only to appear later and they certainly appeared and they all had the name Biden on them or just about all almost all, they all had the name Biden on him, which is a little strange

  我们也被拒绝进入观察乔治亚州的一些关键计票处，选举之夜，数个摇摆州的计票中止了数小时，主要的民主党运作的机票点，计票结果很晚才公布出来，后来，大量选票自然出现了，而且都是，或几乎都是，投拜登的选票，这有点奇怪。
 </p>
 <p>
  I challenge Joe and every democrat to clarify that they only want legal votes. Because they talk about votes and I think we should use the word “legal” - legal votes, we want every legal vote counted and I want every legal vote counted.
 </p>
 <p>
  我向乔（拜登）和每个民主人士提出挑战，请他们做出澄清：他们只要合法选票。 因为他们谈到了计票，我认为我们应该采用「合法」一词，合法选票。我们要的是每张合法选票都被计入，我要的是每张合法选票都被计入。
 </p>
 <p>
  We want openness and transparency, no secret count rooms, no mystery ballots, no illegal votes being cast after election day. You have Election Day and the laws are very strong on that, you have an election that, and they don't want to vote cast after election day and they want the process to be an honest one. So important. We want an honest election, we want an honest count. And we want honest people working back there because it's a very important job, so that's the way, this country is going to win, that's the way the United States will win. And we think we will win the election very easily, we think there's going to be a lot of litigation, because we have so much evidence so much proof and it's going to end up, perhaps at the highest court in the land. We'll see. But we think there'll be a lot of litigation because we can't have an election stolen by, like this and I tell you I would, I have been talking about this for many months with all of you.

  我们想要公开透明，没有秘密的暗箱操作，没有神秘的选票，没有在选举日之后投入的非法投票。 有大选日，法律上规定的很清楚，他们不想人们在选举日之后投票，他们想要选举过程诚实。这非常重要。 我们想要一个诚实的选举，我们想要一个诚实的计票， 我们想要诚实的选务人员在那里工作，因为这是一项非常重要的工作。所以，这就是这个国家将要赢得胜利的方式，这就是美国将赢得胜利的方式。 而且我们认为我们将很轻松胜选，我们认为将会有很多诉讼，因为我们有这么多的证据和凭证，而且最终可能会在这个国家的最高法院得到裁决。 我们拭目以待。 但是我们认为将会有很多诉讼，因为我们不能让一场选举就这样被窃取，而且我跟你们讲，很多个月以来，我就一直在和你们所有的人谈及此事。
 </p>
 <p>
  And I've said very strongly that mail in ballots are going to end up being a disaster. Small elections were disaster small very easy to handle. Big elections were disastrous. This is a large scale version and it's getting worse and worse every day, we're hearing stories that are horror stories absolute horror stories. And we can't let that happen to the United States of America.
 </p>
 <p>
  我已经非常坚决地说，邮寄选票最终将变成是一场灾难。邮寄选票，对小规模的选举是灾难性的，但因其小，非常容易处理，对大的选举，则是灾难性的。 这是一场大规模的（邮寄选票），情形每天都在日益恶化，我们在听到越来越多的惊悚故事，绝对惊悚。 我们不能任由这种情形在美国发生。
 </p>
 <p>
  It's not a question of who wins, republican, democrat, Joe, myself. We can't let that happen to our country. We can't be disgraced by having something like this happen.

 <p>
  这不是谁输谁赢的问题，不管你是共和党人，还是民党人，不管你是乔（拜登），还是我本人， 我们不能让这种事情在我们的国家发生。 我们不能因为发生这样的事情，而使得美国蒙羞。
 </p>
 <p>
  So it will be hopefully cleared up maybe soon I hope soon, but it'll probably go through a process, a legal process and as you know I've claimed certain states and he's claiming states so we can both claim states but ultimately I have a feeling judges are going to have to rule. But there's been a lot of shenanigans and we can't stand for that in our country. Thank you very much.

  因此，我希望很快就可以云开见日，可能用不了多久，我希望快一些，但是它可能会经过一个程序，一个司法程序，并且正如你们所知，我已经指称一些州有问题，而他（拜登）也在指称几个州有问题，所以我们都可以指称认为有问题的州，但最终，我觉得，还是要法官们来裁决。 但是，这么多的鬼把戏已经发生了，而在我们的国家，我们不允许这样的事情发生。 非常谢谢大家！
